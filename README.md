# Defend Earth

Hi,

This is a game about shooting alien ships that come to invade Earth. It was created as a project for a coding bootcamp.

Link to the game: https://defend-earth-ee5bc2.netlify.app/

Controls: {
left: A
Right: D
Shoot: K
}

## Here's some of the features I added:

- There is a health bar that turns red when your health gets real low.

- After 1000 points, the boss appears! Sadly, I didn't have time to figure out the logic to make him challenging.

  - Player can shoot projectiles
  - Boss spawns projectiles
  - Music for main stage and boss fight
  - Score text

  Thank you for reading!
